# Changelog

The 1.x wire format is frozen, so this records what changed *around* it: security
fixes, bridges, tooling, and the handful of local-policy changes that alter how a
node behaves without altering what goes on the wire.

Two conventions specific to this project:

- **Wire status is stated on every entry.** "Wire unchanged" means
  `cargo run --example gen_vectors` still produces `reference/vectors.json`
  byte-for-byte, so every reference decoder and every 1.x peer is unaffected.
- **Security fixes reference their finding.** `S-0nn` links to
  [`docs/SECURITY_FINDINGS.md`](docs/SECURITY_FINDINGS.md), which carries the
  reproduction, root cause and regression test for each one.

## Unreleased

Wire unchanged throughout. One frozen *Rust* signature changed (`Node::send`);
`bindings/spore.h` and the vectors are untouched.

### Security

The remote-denial-of-service class is closed: nothing known remains that lets a
peer on the medium crash a node, exhaust its memory, or use it as an amplifier.

- **S-001** A `FRAGMENT` with `count == 0` reached `idx % count` and panicked. One
  public packet, no key, repeatable — any peer could stop any node in earshot.
  Found by the new robustness harness on its first run.
- **S-002 / S-004** Neighbour learning, path learning and quota attribution all
  bound identity from the `SIGNED` **flag** rather than a verified signature. A
  copied public key and 64 zero bytes redirected a victim's directed mail or drained
  their byte budget. Relays now verify before binding trust state — and still do not
  verify merely to forward.
- **S-003** A stamp of class 1 — about two hashes' work, and half of all envelopes
  by luck — bypassed both per-source quotas and backpressure, so §10 bounded
  nothing. `STAMP_QUOTA_BYPASS_BITS = 16` now gates the exemption.
- **S-005** Fifteen `extern "C"` functions could unwind a panic across the C ABI,
  which is undefined behaviour; a wrapper passing a null key triggered it. Guarded,
  and the pointer helpers no longer panic.
- **S-006 / S-013 / S-016 / S-017** Eleven tables a peer could grow without bound —
  neighbours, dedup, incomplete fountain sets, peer records, manifests, receipts,
  inboxes, imported filenames, and the ratchet's skipped-key cache. All capped and
  expired. Every eviction degrades a capability rather than breaking one.
- **S-007 / S-015** Six unbounded filesystem reads on directories other programs
  write to by design, two of them with a `metadata`-then-read gap. One shared
  `store::read_capped` now bounds the read itself.
- **S-008** The Reticulum UDP bridge fed its KISS framer from any source, so a
  stranger's bytes corrupted a frame the companion was midway through.
- **S-012** `WANT` answered every id it was handed with a whole stored envelope:
  32x amplification measured, replayable forever because INV/WANT bypass dedup and
  the quota. Now bounded per packet and per link.
- **S-018** A panic under the hub mutex poisoned it, and every later
  `lock().unwrap()` panicked too — one fault killed every bridge thread
  permanently. Poisoning is now recovered from.

### Changed — local policy, not wire

Both alter how a node behaves on a network without changing what it emits, so a
node running this interoperates with a 1.0 peer that is simply more permissive.

- Mail must be stamped to **16 leading zero bits** (was: any non-zero stamp) to skip
  the per-source quota or a busy peer's backpressure.
- Relays **verify a signature before writing identity into local state** (neighbour,
  path and quota tables). Forwarding still does no crypto. Rationale and the cost on
  constrained hardware: [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md).

### Changed — API

- `Node::send` returns `Result<Vec<Forward>, TooLarge>` instead of panicking when an
  object needs more than 255 fountain chunks (**S-011**). `Hub::send` forwards the
  error. This changed a frozen signature and landed under `allow-frozen-change`; the
  wire format did not move.

### Added — bridges

AX.25/KISS, Tor (SOCKS5), I2P (SAM v3, dial and accept), copyparty/WebDAV, UDP
multicast on any address family (which unblocked Yggdrasil, cjdns, BATMAN and
Thread), Reticulum over TCP/UDP, ICMP echo, and NNCP/UUCP via a new spool bridge.
Every native stream bridge now shares `bridge::stream_link` with automatic
reconnection and exponential backoff.

### Added — tooling

- `src/robustness.rs` — always-on malformed-input harness over every parser a
  stranger can reach. It found S-001.
- `fuzz/` — five libFuzzer targets in their own workspace, plus a scheduled
  workflow, so nightly never becomes a build requirement.
- `.github/workflows/msrv.yml` — installs the toolchain named by `rust-version` and
  runs the suite. **S-014** was that claim being false in two ways at once, so it is
  now enforced by something that executes.
- `.github/workflows/supply-chain.yml` — `cargo-audit`, `cargo-deny`, a
  bindings-in-sync check, and an offline-bundle job that vendors and then builds
  with an empty `CARGO_HOME`.
- `scripts/make-offline-bundle.sh` — **S-010**: `CONTINUITY.md` promised an offline
  rebuild the repo could not perform. The claim is now true and CI proves it.
- Dependabot, and SHA-256 checksums on release assets.

### Documentation

`docs/SECURITY_FINDINGS.md` (the findings register, also published to the site),
`SECURITY.md`, this changelog, per-bridge privacy profiles in `BRIDGES.md`, the
stamp deployer note, and the DESIGN section explaining what "relays never verify"
does and does not mean.

### Fixed

- ICMP assumed a 20-byte IP header, silently dropping every packet carrying options
  — which is what a "diagnostics only" network adds, and that is the network the
  bridge exists for (**S-009**).
- The offline bundle was 290 MB of build output; excluding artifacts properly brings
  it to 6.6 MB, verified to still build cold from a clean extraction.
- Rust 1.75 compatibility restored in earnest: `zeroize_derive` pinned, lockfile
  regenerated at version 3, and four uses of post-1.75 APIs replaced.

## 1.0.0

The frozen contract: envelope format, the five medium shapes, `bindings/spore.h`,
`reference/vectors.json`, and the reference decoders. Everything since has been
built without moving any of it.
